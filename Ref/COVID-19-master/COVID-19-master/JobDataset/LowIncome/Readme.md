Description of file: 
"The Urban Institute data science team used data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, IPUMS 2012-2018 ACS microdata, r and Urbanâ€™s 2017 Census LODES data 
to estimate the number of low-income jobs (<$40,000 salary) lost because of COVID-19 by industry for every census tract in the US based on the residence of 
workers. The code, and more information about the methodology used to generate the data, can be found here, and the interactive data visualization powered 
by these data can be found here. The data are available at the tract, county, or core-based statistical area level. LODES data by Census tract by income level 
used in this analysis can be found on the data catalog here."

The curated dataset is an excel file (JobLoss.xlsx) with two sheets corresponding to overall job loss and low income job loss.
